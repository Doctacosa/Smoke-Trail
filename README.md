# SmokeTrail

This Minecraft plugin allows users with the correct permission to leave a trail of particle behind them as they walk, dazzling others in style! A common use for it is to reward contributors to a Minecraft server or community.

This fork updates the original plugin to be compatible with recent Spigot releases. Supports 1.14 at the time of writing. This version also relies on Spigot's modern API to handle the particles, rather than use Minecraft's internals, making it less prone to breakage between game versions. Some non-working trails have been removed.
